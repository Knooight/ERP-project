# ERP PROJECT

Made a simple  Enterprise Resource Planner code.
## What can it do?
 
<p>My ERP system has two options<br>
     ‣ Admin Management<br>
     ‣ Purchase Management</p>

#### THE ADMIN MANAGEMENT

<p>Admin can only Update the stocks and price</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of how it looks-</p>


#### THE PURCHASE MANAGEMENT

<p>Salesman uses a purchase management XD.</p>
